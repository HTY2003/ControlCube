# ControlCube
A cube of keyboard switches.
It was very bad.
It's taken apart now.
But this is a log :D

This repo includes:
* Rhino3D Design Files for the case and keycaps
* STL exports of the design files for easy viewing
* EAGLE design files for the controller board, switchplate, and switchboard
* Gerber exports of the design files for easy viewing
